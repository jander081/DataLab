# DataLab Projects
UWF DataLab project demos

Graduate Research Assistant at UWF Predictive Analytics and Modeling (PAM) lab. Included some demos/scripts 
from the PAM lab. Dataset sample shown is anonymized. The primary project focus was both descriptive and 
predictive. Essentially, understanding academic trends and predicting academic performance concerns in advance 
for preemptive action (identity students likely to struggle).

I'll include some work. However, these are ongoing projects with the PAM lab and personal/university information
will be anonymized/ommitted.
